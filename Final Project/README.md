Running the application is quite simple, here are the steps that can be followed. 

1) First, the user will get onto the site and be prompted to the "About Page". This is a simple page where they can read about
the website and what it does. 

2) After the user reads a little about the site they can click the "Fortune Teller" tab at the top to get to the "Fortune Teller"
page. Here they will find the "Fortune Teller" feature. The user can then type in their question or concern into the text box. They
will then click the "Click To Receive Fortune" button to get their fortune in the form of an alert. There are 12 possible responses. The button will turn purple after being clicked. The user's questions will be put into the "Questions asked" array in the bottom left corner. Here they will be able to review their asked questions and remove them if they feel neccessary. There are two photos on each side of the page providing visuals for fun. 

3) Finally, after the user is done using the "Fortune Teller", and if they have any questions or concerns they can go to the "Contact Page". Here they will find a form (or multiple text boxes) that are used to get their information. They will need to enter their name,
number, email, and they'll have the option to provide their comments and last name. After they enter their information they can click the "Submit" button and the information will be "sent" (except for now, it is not being sent anywhere).
